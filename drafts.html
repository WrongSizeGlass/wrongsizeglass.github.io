                    The game was a solo project during my thrid semester on my master, so I did everything in this project.

            Dialog based game where your repution is based on your characters social groups. </summary><br>
            <br>  The write one or two paragraphs describing your game. <br></br>
        <section> 
            It is dialog based game, where the reputation system is inpiret by the intersectional framework and systemic game design. <br>
            The goal behind the project was so see if the players could identify if they experiance intersectional biases, based on the dialog they encountered. <br>
            Where the player will play the game twice with different characters, depended on how the NPCs likes the player they might get rewarded for doing their quest. <br>

            It is a 3D inspiret platformer game, made for a student project where the goal was to see if the players perceived a lessened difficulty if the quest structure was linear or opened. <br>
            In addition to this the subgoal was to see how people tend to solve problems in games with the use of their game mechanics. <br>
            The game is about: You are a raccon who fixes the a towns problems, picking up some doughnuts someone has thrown around to make a mess <br>
            fixing a fountain that can't get water. Lastly fixing a power plant that has lost it cuircute <br>

        <h4> Dialog based game, where NPCs will react differently towards the player based on the players character.</h4>
            The goal behind the project was so see if the players could identify if they experiance intersectional biases, based on the dialog they encountered. <br>
            The NPC and the player should have distinct dialog depended on what the player and the active NPC looks like, and the NPC should react to the player based on NPC's current perception of the player. <br>
            Negativ interactions should not be hurtful to the player, thus the characters should not be humannoid, so negativ dialog can be negativ with the player might reflect the comments on themselfs.

        <h4>Lighthearted chill game, fixing weird problems in the city.</h4>
            As the main goal of the project was to findout how people would solve problems in a game and in a linear vs open quest apporch.<br>
            The player should feel not feel stress which could resolve in a high cognitive load from other than solving the problems.<br>
            The problems can be weird allowing for a weird comment about the problem to the player, to gain a cheap grin from them, since their motivation to participate in the test is important, as it is within group test.
      
        
        <section> Design value </section>
            <h4> Negative interactions should not be hurtful to the player, but should be direct enough so the player knows that they are in a negative interaction</h4>
            <h4> The quest the NPCs gives to the player should be simple enough, as the player should focus on the dialog interactions </h4>


            <h4> The player needs to figurer out a soluction with out telling them, implicit signifiers are allowed.</h4>
            <h4> The solutions to the problems needs to be solvable by movement and or grabbing mechanics </h4>
