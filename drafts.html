        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <summary> Describe your game in one-sentence <br></br>
            You are a raccon who fixes all the problems the city has, without the humans notices it. </summary><br>
            <br>  The write one or two paragraphs describing your game. <br></br>
        <section> 
            It is a 3D inspiret platformer game, made for a student project where the goal was to see if the players perceived a lessened difficulty if the quest structure was linear or opened. <br>
            In addition to this the subgoal was to see how people tend to solve problems in games with the use of their game mechanics. <br>
            The game is about: You are a raccon who fixes the a towns problems, picking up some doughnuts someone has thrown around to make a mess <br>
            fixing a fountain that can't get water. Lastly fixing a power plant that has lost it cuircute <br>

        <h4>Lighthearted chill game, fixing weird problems in the city.</h4>
            As the main goal of the project was to findout how people would solve problems in a game and in a linear vs open quest apporch.<br>
            The player should feel not feel stress which could resolve in a high cognitive load from other than solving the problems.<br>
            The problems can be weird allowing for a weird comment about the problem to the player, to gain a cheap grin from them, since their motivation to participate in the test is important, as it is within group test.

            <h4> The player needs to figurer out a soluction with out telling them, implicit signifiers are allowed.</h4>
            <h4> The solutions to the problems needs to be solvable by movement and or grabbing mechanics </h4>

        <h2> Level summary </h2>
        <h4> LVL1 mechanics needed </h4> Movement, jumping and running jump.
        <h4> LVL1 obstacles </h4> Height, spaces between trees and buildings.
        <h4> LVL1 setting </h4> Around and on a doughnut shop in the city.
        <h4> LVL1 Description </h4> This level is meant to teach the basic movement mechanics and running jump to the player.
       
        <h4> LVL2 mechanics needed </h4> Movement, jumping, grabbing objects.
        <h4> LVL2 obstacles </h4> objects are to heigh so the player needs to grab and object they can stand on in order to jump on the objects.
        <h4> LVL2 setting </h4> In the park in the city.
        <h4> LVL2 Description </h4> This level is meant to teach the player the grabbing mechaning and its utilities.
        
        <h4> LVL3 mechanics needed </h4> Movement, jumping, running jump, and grabbing.
        <h4> LVL3 obstacles </h4> they need to find a way up, broad jumps.
        <h4> LVL3 setting </h4> On the power plant in the city.
        <h4> LVL3 Description </h4> This level is meant let the player be creative get on top the powerplant.
