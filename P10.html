                    Ragnarock was a game prototype I co-developeded for my Master thesis. 
                    The goal of the project was to explor peoples wayfinding abilites and cognitiv maps. <br> 
                    Thus designing a city where it was easy to navigate in was a goal.</br>
                    The to cities I designed for the project was build around two of the ecological models: sector model and the multiple nuclai.<br>
                    The general Image grid pattern on the page, will show the multiple Nuclie level in the top grid and the Sector level in the bottom grid. <br>

                    The game setting was inpired by north methology. The narrator in the game was Thor's hammer Mj√∏lner.

                When I design levels I prefer to design for them with player agency in mind, so when I design with traversial in mind I designed it few bindpaths so the mainpaths was easy to reconise, I also design the city where the player are able to create shortcuts through the city, and of course provide them with navigational aid.<br>
                I also takes the gameplay mechanics and story intoconsideration when I design, to create a silver lining through the game experiance, which also includes the quest structure in this prototype <br> 
                
                <br>
                The most left images shows task locations in the level, and the right most images shows, a player tracking 3D heartmap of my design, but in short the more dense the colors are the more people have been at that point. </br>
                <br> Color code: red is the player is doing the quest from 1 to 6. Green means the player is during the quest from 6 to 11. Lastly the blue shows the last quest where the player needs to defeat a boss down at the harbour. </br>
                The white lines shows the primary pathsways between the quests.<br>
                The heartmaps have been very educational, to see which paths the players generally takes, where they tend to explore and which areas fewer players explorers.

                    While the goal of the prototype was to test the players cognitiv map of the city as mentioned earlier, it was desided to have basic game mechanics
                    like basic movement, jump and the ability to through a hammer.  <br>
                    To end the game on a high note from walking around the town, it was desided that they should fight a boss at the end of the game and some of the task the player needed to do during the game should learn them how to defeat it.
                    The boss's weakpoint is icecrystals and make the player associate icecrystals as the boss's weakpoints. <br> Two icecrystals was placed in the city with a spirit trapped inside of. Which the player needed to free.

                    Introducing enemy and enemy fire <br>
                    The boss the player needs to defeat was inspired by Naglfar from north methology, where there is three ice spirits that controls its and attacks with area effects. <br>
                    In order to introduce both of these, the player meets one near the church, and here the player needs to learn to avoid the area effects. The player needs to turn on 2 bonfires.

                    The Boss <br>
                    As mentioned ealier, we wanted the game to end on a high note so the boss introduction was important, the last video shows this introduction. <br>
                    To make the boss fight seem more interesting, I design the boss so that it could destroy docks as well as forcing the player not to get to close to the boss
