                    Ragnarock was a game prototype I co-developeded for my Master thesis <br>
                    The goal of the project was to design and create a city which was easy to navigate in.</br>
                    The to cities I designed for the project was build around two of the ecological models: sector model and the multiple nuclai.<br>

                    The general Image grid pattern on the page, will show the multiple Nuclie level in the top grid and the Sector level in the bottom grid.

            <div class="right-text" style="background: #ffecd5; padding-top: 50px;"> 
                When I design levels I prefer to design for them with player agency in mind, so when I design with traversial in mind I design in this case the city with a few bindpaths as possible and tries to make sure the player can find their own short cuts to their destination, and ofcourse provide them with navigational aid, and in this prototype a moving spirit would spawn that would walk toward the objective if the player could not find the path. <br>
                I also takes the gameplay mechanics and story intoconsideration when I design, to create a silver lining through the game experiance.  <br> 
                Which many players made use of as can be seen on the right images, which are described below. </br>

                <br>
                The most left images shows task locations in the level, and the right most images shows, a player tracking 3D heartmap of my design, but in short the more dense the colors are the more people have been at that point. </br>
                <br> Color code: red is the player is doing the quest from 1 to 6. Green means the player is during the quest from 6 to 11. Lastly the blue shows the last quest where the player needs to defeat a boss down at the harbour. </br>
