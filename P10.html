                    Ragnarock was a game prototype I co-developeded for my Master thesis <br>
                    The goal of the project was to explor peoples wayfinding abilites and cognitiv maps so designing and creating a city which was easy to navigate in was a goal.</br>
                    The to cities I designed for the project was build around two of the ecological models: sector model and the multiple nuclai.<br>
                    The general Image grid pattern on the page, will show the multiple Nuclie level in the top grid and the Sector level in the bottom grid. <br>

                    The game setting was inpired by north methology. The narrator in the game was Thor's hammer Mj√∏lner.

                When I design levels I prefer to design for them with player agency in mind, so when I design with traversial in mind I designed it few bindpaths so the mainpaths was easy to reconise, I also design the city where the player are able to create shortcuts through the city, and of course provide them with navigational aid.<br>
                I also takes the gameplay mechanics and story intoconsideration when I design, to create a silver lining through the game experiance, which also includes the quest structure in this prototype <br> 
                
                <br>
                The most left images shows task locations in the level, and the right most images shows, a player tracking 3D heartmap of my design, but in short the more dense the colors are the more people have been at that point. </br>
                <br> Color code: red is the player is doing the quest from 1 to 6. Green means the player is during the quest from 6 to 11. Lastly the blue shows the last quest where the player needs to defeat a boss down at the harbour. </br>
                The white lines shows the primary pathsways between the quests.<br>
                The heartmaps have been very educational, to see which paths the players generally takes, where they tend to explore and which areas fewer players explorers.
